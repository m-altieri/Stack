# Stack
*A simple stack to demonstrate JUnit basics*

A stack is a LIFO sequence. Addition and removal takes place **only** at one end, called the top.

Operations:
- `push(x)`: add a new element on the top
- `pop`: remove the item at the top
- `peek`: return the item at the top (without removing it)
- `size`: return the number of items on the stack
- `isEmpty`: return whether the stack has not items
